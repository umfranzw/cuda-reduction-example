This example starts with a simple sum reduction in CUDA, then steps through a series of optimizations we can perform to improve its performance on the GPU. These examples were created alongside a series of lectures (on GPGPU computing) for an undergraduate parallel computing course. You can find the lecture slides in the slides/ directory.
