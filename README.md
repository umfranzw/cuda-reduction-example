# cuda-reduction-example
This example starts with a simple sum reduction in CUDA, then steps through a series of optimizations we can perform to improve its performance on the GPU.

These examples were created alongside a series of lectures (on GPGPU computing) for an undergraduate parallel computing course. You can find the lecture slides [here](http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~umfranzw/resources/ParallelComputingWithGPUs.pdf).
